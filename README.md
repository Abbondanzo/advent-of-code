# Advent of Code

This repository contains my work for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge, a fun way to challenge my friends and coworkers throughout the month of December on small programming puzzles. If you are also participating in the challenge, be sure to avoid checking here until you complete your challenges because I might spoil the solutions for you--I like to keep this up-to-date so I can work from different machines.
